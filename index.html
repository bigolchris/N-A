          My career in progress

            <p>
              While I like to believe that I am always up for a challenge there
              are things that have made me apprehensive to persue these
              challenges, but taking the dive and working in a bootcamp has made
              me realize there is no problem too big that I can't takle as long
              as I put the effort in and set my mind to it. I am in the very
              early stages of my career, only having basic to intermediete
              knowledge on technologies like Javascript, HTML, CSS and others
              but I plan to take steps in furthing my knowledge since I have a
              drive to learn!
