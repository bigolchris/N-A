                <p>Hey! My name is Christian Sanchez as you may already know by looking at my landing page but there is more to
                    me than just what I want my career to be, and this is where I will tell all.
                    When I was younger I always knew I wanted to do something with technology but I didnt know exactly what that was, I was 
                    always interested in video games and thought maybe I would want to be the person that made video games. As I got older I 
                    realized that was a lot more difficult than just having cool ideas. When I was younger I also got heavily into skateboarding
                    which is something I spent a lot of my life doing so much so that its still an activity that is still very much so in my life that
                    I still do it to this day. Along with video games of course that is an addiction that will never go away. I knew as I was 
                    finishing high school that doing something with technology is something that I should really consider even if it 
                    wasnt completely clear at the time, as I was going to college to become a therapist, I always wanted to help 
                    people but being in school was something that could never hold my interest. I was never a good student always 
                    finding someway to not do my work even when I knew I was supposed to, but learning about something that I have complete 
                    interest in is easier than having to learn things I could care less about to get to the parts I want. This is where the bootcamp
                    came in, I knew this because it completely focuses on what im interested in not a bunch of "padding".
